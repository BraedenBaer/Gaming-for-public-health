Using a system like Bubble can have many advantages for beginner app developers such as myself but it can also have a few disadvantages as well. Some of the pros include being able to create any app I want without worrying if I had entered the code wrong, yet I see this as a cons as well as being able to see the code and work with it give me time to practice and perfect my coding skills. Another pro is that the time it takes to build a simple app which I did in less than an hour or so, which would have taken longer in other systems.And the an issue with that is I worry that using apps like this I tend to forget some other the material Iâ€™ve learned with in favor of using a new system. Bubble is a great website for novice designers like me, yet those who have been building apps without Bubble may see it as a beginner system rather than one that will match their skills.
